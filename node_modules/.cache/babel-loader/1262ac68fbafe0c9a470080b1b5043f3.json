This internal frame can be constructed using a multitude of things you’ll find anywhere – branches, archways, tunnels, door frames etc., as well as things that aren’t solid like light, shadows, rain, fog, etc. – it doesn’t matter what you use.\"},{id:11,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/goldenhour_hFBOg0Mfs1z.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160218058\",title:\"Golden Hours\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"The golden hour starts roughly one hour after sunrise and one hour before sunset.The golden hour is known for producing beautiful natural light that is easy to work with. It’s hard to overexpose or underexpose parts of an image, like a subject’s face, because the light is very even and has a beautiful golden hue. After the sun sets, you’ll be treated to the “Blue Hour,” the brief window of time following sunset, when the world is bathed in a deep blue color. If you’re already out, stick around for a few blue hour photos.Plus, the golden hour creates a warm color temperature, which can be enhanced (or reduced) in post-processing.

Not everyone understands that a lightning storm is highly unpredictable, and how a strike could occur any time.At the same time, taking a picture of a lightning strike can be very rewarding, especially if the pattern is unique or the picture is taken at an extraordinary location. You can lower your risk by setting up your camera mounted on a tripod outside, and use a remote shutter or timer from the interior of your home.When shooting lightning, I usually set my camera to manual mode.Whether I'm shooting with a cable release or remote control, I usually start by setting the shutter to BULB, the aperture around f/5.6, and ISO to 400.

This effect can be achieved with a slow shutter speed in a dark place, so usually light painting images are made at night.Using either a moving camera or a moving light source, the lens captures an illusion of growing paint. Some photographers take an object that would be illuminated along with play of lights.

Because the shutter is opened for a few seconds (or even more) the light creates a trail across the image showing the path that it took.It is one of the fun and creative ways you can use long exposure photography. Light trails are one of the best ways to add a wow factor to your urban night photography. Traffic and car light trails show the frenetic rhythm of life in large cities. Cityscapes, landscapes, and even portraits can make great use of light trails to create a sense of energy and motion in the image and add color to an otherwise dreary scene. Light trails create a sense of speed and energy in the image. You can freeze moving lights with a fast enough shutter speed. Or you can record them as luminous trails with long enough shutter speeds.\"},{id:15,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/perspective_RJSXb_8cIr.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160225521\",title:\"Perspective\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Perspective in photography is defined as the sense of depth or spatial relationship between objects in a photo, along with their dimensions with respect to what viewer of the image sees. By changing perspective, subjects can appear differently. Instead of shooting straight ahead, point your lens up or down and capture subjects and objects from an angle that you would not normally view them from. It is an element of composition in that the photo can be taken from different angles. We should always look to take photographs with a fresh perspective. Another way to change up the perspective of an image is to shoot through objects. Let the object be what draws the eye to the focal point. Crystal balls, openings in fences, and even cell phones are a few fun ways to incorporate this technique. When you begin to look through things and use them as the frame for your subject, you can really start to see them in a new and interesting way. \"},{id:16,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/longexposure_Y3pHXpQHno.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160221700\",title:\"Long Exposure\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Long exposure refers to taking a photograph with shutter speeds of between a few seconds to a few hours and is a great technique to capture striking landscape photos. It makes everyday scenes look otherworldly, like snapshots from a dream. And yet, all you’ve done, technically, is leave the shutter open for longer. The key to getting incredible long exposures is, you will need to secure your camera on a tripod. Hand holding a camera with a shutter speed of even 1 second will produce a blurred image. Set your ISO depending on the scene and use Shutter Priority (Tv) mode to adjust your shutter speed up to 30 seconds. ND filters come in handy for daytime long exposures, but if you don’t have one, plan to shoot at night or in a dark indoor setting.\"},{id:17,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/macro_vOJTHsXbcDW.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160222206\",title:\"Macro\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Macro photography is the art of taking close-up pictures that reveal details which can’t be seen with the naked eye. For example, while we can see the fly on the wall, our eyes aren’t equipped to make out the fine details of the hairs on it’s face. This is where macro photography comes in.

Human eyes are very expressive because they can portray a whole range of emotions, like strength, love, fear, confidence, playfulness and so on. A portrait with the eyes in focus will surely be more appealing and draw the viewer into the image, so it makes sense to work hard in order to achieve it. Light source reflected off the surface of the eye plays important role for capturing better eyes in portrait photography from the aesthetic point of view. Catchlights add more drama to the image and in a way they make the portrait come to life.\"},{id:19,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/moon_5Y00bNXsRw.jpg?updatedAt=1631160223036\",title:\"Moon\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"The sky has always been a popular subject for photographers. The moon will usually look like a flat white circle and will be too far away to become the focus of your image. But when you add Moon to a scene, it automatically beutify the image with its presence. An important concept in all astrophotography is “lucky imaging,” which boils down to taking lots of photos so that you get at least a few in which the atmosphere was unusually steady, the camera didn’t shake, and the focus was perfect. Astrophotography is a complete different world of wonders.You can't peep into the universe by ur naked eyes but this doesn't mean you can't enjoy this photography.Be little creative and it will do wow like it did to this picture.\"},{id:20,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/reflection_vRsp5uOGzKQ.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160227482\",title:\"Reflection\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Reflections can be tricky to capture because they involve you looking at your perspective differently, or in a less traditional sense than you normally would. You have to start by changing your perspective – take your shots upside down. You want your viewer to look at the world from a new viewpoint. It will take time and consideration to get the perfect shots, but the end results can be extremely rewarding. Though reflection photographs can be used to add depth and interest; they can also act as a frame, for capturing an image within an image – pretty clever, and artistically original all at the same time. From reflections of trees in lakes, to shots of new buildings with their surroundings reflected within them, there are plenty of ways a photographer can shoot and use reflections to their advantage\"},{id:21,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/nature_WqctsF13cNU.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160224468\",title:\"Nature\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Nature photography covers shooting flora and fauna. This means plants, flowers, and animals, photographed in their immediate environments.

If you take photos of wildlife, then you will be forever capturing moments that will never be repeated. You have an opportunity to record something truly unique. Nature photography is extremely therapeutic if you can reap enjoyment from it. If you have had a stressful week, heading out to be alone with your camera and the natural world can be a great way to wind down and forget any troubles.When done correctly, it allows people to experience things they may not see themselves by transporting the viewer into your shoes, allowing them to imagine the scene as if they were there with you.\"},{id:22,imgsrc:\"https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/tr:w-300/occasional_uvb9hhS0nmr.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160225309\",title:\"Festives\",linksrc:\"\",content:\"Shooting at any type of festival photography, it requires a lot of patience and preplanning.

Because with festival photography it’s important to remember that although we may not be accomplished authors, we are visual storytellers. Furthermore, our shots should always tell a story, convey emotion and engage the viewer.

The best time of day for silhouette shooting is either early in the morning or late in the day, when the sun is on the horizon.
