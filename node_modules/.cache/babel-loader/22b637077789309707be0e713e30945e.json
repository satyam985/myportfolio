Light trails are one of the best ways to add a wow factor to your urban night photography. Traffic and car light trails show the frenetic rhythm of life in large cities. Cityscapes, landscapes, and even portraits can make great use of light trails to create a sense of energy and motion in the image and add color to an otherwise dreary scene.

By changing perspective, subjects can appear differently. Instead of shooting straight ahead, point your lens up or down and capture subjects and objects from an angle that you would not normally view them from. It is an element of composition in that the photo can be taken from different angles. We should always look to take photographs with a fresh perspective. Another way to change up the perspective of an image is to shoot through objects. Let the object be what draws the eye to the focal point. Crystal balls, openings in fences, and even cell phones are a few fun ways to incorporate this technique. When you begin to look through things and use them as the frame for your subject, you can really start to see them in a new and interesting way. \"\n}, {\n  id: 16,\n  imgsrc: `https://ik.imagekit.io/satyamimages/mypics/longexposure_Y3pHXpQHno.jpeg?updatedAt=1631160221700`,\n  title: \"Long Exposure\",\n  linksrc: ``,\n  content: \"Long exposure refers to taking a photograph with shutter speeds of between a few seconds to a few hours and is a great technique to capture striking landscape photos.

The key to getting incredible long exposures is, you will need to secure your camera on a tripod. Hand holding a camera with a shutter speed of even 1 second will produce a blurred image. Set your ISO depending on the scene and use Shutter Priority (Tv) mode to adjust your shutter speed up to 30 seconds.
