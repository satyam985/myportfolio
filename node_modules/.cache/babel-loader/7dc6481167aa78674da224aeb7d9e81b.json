After the sun sets, you’ll be treated to the “Blue Hour,” the brief window of time following sunset, when the world is bathed in a deep blue color. If you’re already out, stick around for a few blue hour photos.Plus, the golden hour creates a warm color temperature, which can be enhanced (or reduced) in post-processing. This warm color cast is often flattering, like in the photo below:\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 12,\r\n    imgsrc: lightning,\r\n    title: \"Lightning\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content:\r\n      \"Photographing lightning is dangerous. Not everyone understands that a lightning storm is highly unpredictable, and how a strike could occur any time.At the same time, taking a picture of a lightning strike can be very rewarding, especially if the pattern is unique or the picture is taken at an extraordinary location. You can lower your risk by setting up your camera mounted on a tripod outside, and use a remote shutter or timer from the interior of your home.When shooting lightning, I usually set my camera to manual mode.Whether I'm shooting with a cable release or remote control, I usually start by setting the shutter to BULB, the aperture around f/5.6, and ISO to 400.

This effect can be achieved with a slow shutter speed in a dark place, so usually light painting images are made at night.Using either a moving camera or a moving light source, the lens captures an illusion of growing paint. Some photographers take an object that would be illuminated along with play of lights. Beyond a doubt, the background of light while painting photographs plays a huge role in the composition.\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 14,\r\n    imgsrc: lighttrails,\r\n    title: \"Light Trails\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content: \"falls\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 15,\r\n    imgsrc: perspective,\r\n    title: \"Perspective\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content: \"\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 16,\r\n    imgsrc: longexposure,\r\n    title: \"Long Exposure\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content: \"camera\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 17,\r\n    imgsrc: macro,\r\n    title: \"Macro\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content:\r\n      \"Long Exposure Photography can be used to create very interesting photographs.
