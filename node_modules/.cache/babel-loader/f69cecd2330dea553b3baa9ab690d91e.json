After the sun sets, you’ll be treated to the “Blue Hour,” the brief window of time following sunset, when the world is bathed in a deep blue color.

You can lower your risk by setting up your camera mounted on a tripod outside, and use a remote shutter or timer from the interior of your home.When shooting lightning, I usually set my camera to manual mode.Whether I'm shooting with a cable release or remote control, I usually start by setting the shutter to BULB, the aperture around f/5.6, and ISO to 400.

Some photographers take an object that would be illuminated along with play of lights.

Light trails are one of the best ways to add a wow factor to your urban night photography. Traffic and car light trails show the frenetic rhythm of life in large cities. Cityscapes, landscapes, and even portraits can make great use of light trails to create a sense of energy and motion in the image and add color to an otherwise dreary scene. Light trails create a sense of speed and energy in the image. You can freeze moving lights with a fast enough shutter speed.

It will take time and consideration to get the perfect shots, but the end results can be extremely rewarding. Though reflection photographs can be used to add depth and interest; they can also act as a frame, for capturing an image within an image – pretty clever, and artistically original all at the same time. From reflections of trees in lakes, to shots of new buildings with their surroundings reflected within them, there are plenty of ways a photographer can shoot and use reflections to their

Composition refers to how we lay the picture out and how we place objects within the scene to get the most aesthetically pleasing results. The purpose of composition is to guide the viewer’s eye towards the most important elements of your photo, and this we do through careful framing, arrangement and placement of objects within the scene. The most common compositions are Simplicity, Symmetrical balance, Asymmetrical balance, Radial balance, Rule of thirds, Leading lines, Golden Ratio Framing.\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 7,\r\n    imgsrc: creative,\r\n    title: \"Creative\",\r\n    linksrc: ``,\r\n    content:\r\n      \"Creative photography is a photo that is intentionally made more unique, thus making it creative.

Cityscapes, landscapes, and even portraits can make great use of light trails to create a sense of energy and motion in the image and add color to an otherwise dreary scene.
